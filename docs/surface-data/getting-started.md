# 👑 Surface Provenance Data - UIs & Front-ends

## 👑 Surface Provenance Data - UIs & Front-ends

Soon, on CAP's release (first week of November), we will share in-detail guides and documentation on how to integrate CAP into UIs/Frontends to:

- Surface any transactions/history for assets using CAP.
- Surface any transaction data related to users/specific assets.

This will be done using the CAP-js library, that will allow any frontend to communicate with CAP's main canister to query data from any integrated asset.
