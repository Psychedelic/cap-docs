# 👑 Integrating CAP - New & Existing Projects

Soon, on CAP's release (first week of November), we will share in-detail guides and documentation on how to integrate CAP to:

- A new NFT/Token project
- An existing NFT/Token project (migration)

This will be done using the CAP-SDK, that will facilitate both flows for developers.
