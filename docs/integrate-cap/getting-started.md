# ðŸ‘‘ Integrating CAP - New & Existing Projects
## ðŸ‘‘ Integrating CAP - New & Existing Projects

To integrate CAP, a Token or NFT must use the **CAP SDK**. A development kit we created to facilitate the integration of **new or existing projects**.

- Visit [CAP-SDK repository](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap/tree/cap-sdk/sdk) (Early look)

!!! Important

    CAP is currently in development ðŸš§ and will release in the first week of November, thus it is not on mainnet or usable yet. You might see our documentation is light! We're delayed in this to focus on testing, but will soon update this page with guides & detailed examples for developers.
